Important:
* Finish the intergration of the new -user and -type options to putcmsg 
  in xchatter core - amir :)
* Add all ideas/bug fix requests to the TODO document.
* Finish documenting all commands.

Mid-important:
* Make all extentions supports putcmsg -user and putcmsg -type
* Make an extention that works in conjuction with userlist, to allow private
  queries (when you double-click a user, you get a new text buffer, for private
  chat
* Make a /IGNORE command, that will take advantage of the new -user/-type
  options.
* Add the following features to the timer system:
  - Internal (tcl) timer can't be deleted.
  - add DISABLE/ENABLE timer
  - add RENAME timer
  - add INTERVAL <timer> <new interval>, to change timer interval
  - add tcl-level commands to handle timer disable/enable/rename/interval
    change.
* Implement a /redirect command, redirects putchat output to various places:
  - to the global chat
  - to a user
  - to the stdbuf (history buffer)
  - to the inputline
  - to the void

Less urgent:
* Add alias-based events:
    - onglob
    - ondisconnect
    - onconnected
    - ...
* Write help files.
* Add a logging system, probably based on the eventlog.xcp plugin.
  Make it support stripping styles from the log.
* Remove support for old plugin format (and therefore old global plugin
  variable binding).
* Added cool new styles to the styles addon - uri.
  
Maybe:
* Icons addon (interprets special style strings as icon specs)...
* Code a new, xcplus-header like /PLUGIN command, so a plugin defines a name,
  version number, load proc, unload proc, ...
* Implement a /UNLOAD command, make XCPlus extention register as plugins in
  the /PLUGIN command, to /UNLOAD will work for them.
* Integrate the plugin system with XChatter plus extention system, to create
  a simple interface for new plugins, that is similar to XChatter plus extention
  registration
* Add support for creating xcscript timers with COUNT specified - maybe with
  /TIMER CREATE <name> <interval>[:count] command

Already done:
* Add a font choosing option in help.
* Make XChatter function without help.tcl
* Finish the timer system - amir.
* Add a /SINFO command, copy the code from the /SINFO plugin
* Recode /AWAY system to use the new timer system.
* Make INFO/LIST parsing be more protocol-compliant.
