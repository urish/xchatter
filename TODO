Important:
* Finish the intergration of the new -user and -type options to putcmsg 
  in xchatter core - amir :)
* Add all ideas/bug fix requests to the TODO document.
* Finish documenting all commands.

Mid-important:
* Make all extentions supports putcmsg -user and putcmsg -type
* Make an extention that works in conjuction with userlist, to allow private
  queries (when you double-click a user, you get a new text buffer, for private
  chat
* Make a /IGNORE command, that will take advantage of the new -user/-type
  options.
* Add the following features to the timer system:
  - Internal (tcl) timer can't be deleted.
  - add DISABLE/ENABLE timer
  - add RENAME timer
  - add INTERVAL <timer> <new interval>, to change timer interval
  - add tcl-level commands to handle timer disable/enable/rename/interval
    change.
* Implement a /redirect command, redirects putchat output to various places:
  - to the global chat
  - to a user
  - to the stdbuf (history buffer)
  - to the inputline
  - to the void

Less urgent:
* Add alias-based events:
    - onglob
    - ondisconnect
    - onconnected
    - ...
* Write help files.
* Add a logging system, probably based on the eventlog.xcp plugin.
  Make it support stripping styles from the log.
* Added cool new styles to the styles addon - uri.
  
Maybe:
* Add support for creating xcscript timers with COUNT specified - maybe with
  /TIMER CREATE <name> <interval>[:count] command
