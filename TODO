Important:
* Finish the timer system - amir
* Finish the intergration of the new -user and -type options to putcmsg 
  in xchatter core - amir :)
* Add all ideas/bug fix requests to the TODO document.

Mid-important:
* Make all extentions supports putcmsg -user and putcmsg -type
* Make an extention that works in conjuction with userlist, to allow private
  queries (when you double-click a user, you get a new text buffer, for private
  chat
* Make a /IGNORE command, that will take advantage of the new -user/-type
  options.

Less urgent:
* Implement a /redirect command, redirects putchat output to various places:
  - to the global chat
  - to a user
  - to the stdbuf (history buffer)
  - to the inputline
  - to the void
* Add alias-based events:
    - onglob
    - ondisconnect
    - onconnected
    - ...
* Write help files.
* Add a /SINFO command, copy the code from the /SINFO plugin
* Add a logging system, probably based on the eventlog.xcp plugin
* Remove support for old plugin format (and therefore old global plugin
  variable binding).
  
Maybe:
* Code a new, xcplus-header like /PLUGIN command, so a plugin defines a name,
  version number, load proc, unload proc, ...
* Implement a /UNLOAD command, make XCPlus extention register as plugins in
  the /PLUGIN command, to /UNLOAD will work for them.
* Integrate the plugin system with XChatter plus extention system, to create
  a simple interface for new plugins, that is similar to XChatter plus extention
  registration

Already done:
* Add a font choosing option in help
* Make XChatter function without help.tcl
